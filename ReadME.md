Note This repository now contains the code for both Rasa NLU AND Rasa Core. Nothing has changed yet in terms of usage, but we are in the process of simplifying everything ahead of the next major release.

Rasa is a framework for building conversational software, which includes chatbots on:

    Facebook Messenger
    Slack
    Microsoft Bot Framework
    Rocket.Chat
    Mattermost
    Telegram
    Twilio

But you can also build assistants using:

    Alexa Skills
    Google Home Actions

Rasa's primary purpose is to help you build contextual, layered conversations with lots of back-and-forth. To have a real conversation, you need to have some memory and build on things that were said earlier. Rasa lets you do that in a scalable way.

There's a lot more background information in this blog post.
